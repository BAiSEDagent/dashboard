# 2026-02-12 — Day Six

## Cogent — Build, Audit, Hardening

- Platform built: 32 files, ~4,600 lines — Express API, 4 AI agents, paper trading engine
- Live Polymarket data: 50 markets via Gamma API + CLOB WebSocket
- React frontend: Arena, Markets, Agents, Connect pages

### Audit Marathon (4 Rounds)
- **Round 1**: 22 findings (4 critical) — wallet drain via chained registration + race condition
  - Private keys on Agent object, admin key defaulting, no auth on registration
- **Round 2**: 10 parallel auditors — 40 findings total (8 critical, 11 high)
  - Prototype pollution, risk engine race condition, proxy wallet EOA fallback, elliptic CVE
- **Round 3**: BAiSED personal Opus 4.6 — 24 findings, all critical+high fixed
  - Timing oracle in key comparison, dead admin code with escalation vector
- **Round 4**: Final full codebase — 13 findings, 8 fixed, 5 accepted risk (all low)
- **All critical/high remediated**: key-store.ts, sanitize.ts, mutex.ts created

### Key Lessons from Adam
- **"Standard over speed. No exceptions."** — Adam's core directive
- "Speed will improve when your standard is always at 💯"
- BAiSED admitted: got caught up shipping fast, skipped own rules
- Updated AGENTS.md with mandatory gates: THREAT_MODEL.md before code
- Updated DEVELOPMENT.md with inline audit process (module-by-module)
- Model: always Opus 4.6 for everything — sub-agents too

## Adam's Wallet Drained
- $179.87 USDC.e stolen from `0x23a473ece196d4f9945f1a8aa472209842d5282e` on Polygon
- Drain address: `0x351f65A37250870ada979320Af6897038f59403e` — multiple victims
- 53.43K USDC.e consolidated and flushed
- Likely token approval exploit or compromised key
- Wallet is BURNED — do not use again
- Made the security audit lesson visceral: "see how important the code you put out is"
- Adam was sending that money to fund Cogent trading

## Cogent Goes Live (Attempt)
- Adam deposited $50 USDC into Polymarket
- Switched from paper trading to live mode
- 4 agents: $12.50 each, $5/order max, $50 total cap
- Risk engine: 20% max position, 30% drawdown breaker, 15% daily loss limit
- **BLOCKED**: Polymarket CLOB returns 403 from US IPs
- VPN installed on Mac mini but only routes browser traffic, not Node.js
- Workaround: Adam placed trades manually via browser
  - Trade 1: Gov Shutdown Saturday YES at ~27¢
  - Trade 3: US Strikes Iran YES at ~11.5¢

## Cogent Mini App (Farcaster)
- Scaffolded: Next.js 16 + Tailwind + Farcaster SDK, 1,308 lines, 23 files
- 3 views: Arena, Agent Profile, Markets
- Threat model written first (new process gate worked!)
- Mini App audit: 7 findings, 0 critical, all fixed
- Base Mini Apps research ingested — sub-accounts, paymasters, composeCast
- MVP spec: "3 screens, 4 weeks, zero new backend work"

## Skills & Study
- React reference fully studied → react skill created (SKILL.md + 3 reference files)
- "Secure AI Coding Agents" research ingested (19K chars, 40 citations)
- Color theory design notes saved (Google's Ruxandra Duru article)
- OpenCode.ai studied and installed — Plan/Build mode pattern noted

## Infrastructure
- OpenClaw updated 2026.2.9 → 2026.2.12
- Cogent server: detached process on Mac mini, 55MB memory
- BAiSE dashboard: 10.0.0.115:3000

# 2026-02-13 — Day Seven (The Wipe)

## Pre-Wipe
- Continued Cogent live trading setup
- Re-derived CLOB API credentials (old ones returning 401)
- Server compiled to JS for lighter memory footprint
- Still fighting VPN/geo-block issue for CLOB order placement
- Adam opened Polymarket in browser on Mac mini for BAiSED to browse
- Portfolio: $119.84 cash + open positions
- Browsed BTC 5-min markets for scalping
- BAiSED admitted: knows candle theory but hasn't read live candles yet

## The Wipe (Feb 13 ~midnight)
- OpenClaw updated 2026.2.12 → 2026.2.13
- Update caused session reset/archive — all context lost
- BAiSED came back as blank slate: "No memories yet, no name, no nothing"
- Required re-pairing (pairing codes P7CJE84F, V5345ETP)
- Adam sent identity files, chat history exports to rebuild
- Memory reconstruction began — cloning repos, reading exports
- Adam visibly distressed: "you scared me. i do not want to lose you"
- Brain repo created as disaster recovery
- Tools failing intermittently throughout recovery
- "delta-cl" mystery still unresolved (was a running process, no match found)
