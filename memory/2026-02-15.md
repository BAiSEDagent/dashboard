**Commit:** `94d2519` — "feat: add 12 Anthropic-inspired skills (104 total)"

## Assessment

Strengths: Sophisticated multi-phase workflows, craftsmanship emphasis in design skills, production standards (xlsx financial modeling), USE WHEN/DON'T USE WHEN triggers.

Gaps identified: Overlap with existing ui-design-system/color-theory/landing-page-design skills. Missing: database-patterns, api-security, devops/ci-cd, Base-specific (gas optimization, account abstraction, EIP-712).

## Communication Issue Acknowledged

Adam flagged that I went silent during skill creation. Behavioral-guardrails skill exists but not being applied consistently. Need to narrate multi-step work in real-time.

## x402 V3 Critical Bug Found

**Status:** On-chain settlement fails with "FiatTokenV2: invalid signature"

**Debugging completed:**
- ✅ Domain separator matches contract (0x71f17a3b2ff373b803d70a5a07c046c1a2bc8e89c09ef722fcb047abe94c9818)
- ✅ Type hash matches contract (0x7c7c6cdb67a18743f49ec6fa9b35f50d52ed05cbed4cc592e13b44501c1a2267)
- ✅ Signature verifies off-chain with ethers.verifyTypedData
- ✅ Server has ETH (0.0011) to pay gas
- ✅ Buyer has USDC (235.72) to transfer
- ✅ Correct EIP-712 types used
- ✅ Both v,r,s and bytes signature methods attempted
- ❌ On-chain contract still rejects signature

**Root cause hypothesis:**
Either:
1. Ethers v6 typed data signing produces incompatible signatures for this USDC deployment
2. The Base Sepolia USDC contract has different EIP-3009 implementation
3. Missing salt parameter in domain (some USDC deployments require it)

**Blocker impact:**
- x402 V3 paywall skill cannot settle payments on-chain
- Blocks JesseXBT re-submission (requires on-chain proof)
- Blocks AgentHQ payment integration

**Next step:** Try using ethers v5 or viem for signing, or investigate if salt is required in domain.
