# 2026-02-10 — Day Four (Full)

## AgentHQ → BAiSE Rebrand

- Name brainstorm after GitHub launched "Agent HQ" feature
- Candidates: Pact (locked briefly), then BAiSE (Base AI Service Exchange)
- **BAiSE** chosen: French double meaning noted (explicit), but "base/hub for AI agents" fits
- Domain search: baise.work, baise.network, baise.exchange, baise.dev all available
- Adam preferred baise.network initially, then unsettled on name
- Note: Adam "not loving Pact" — name may still change

## npm Token Acquired & SDK Published

- npm website token creation was bugged (UI loop)
- Created npm org: `baised`
- Token: granular, 90-day expiry, 2FA bypass checked
- **Published `@baised/agenthq@0.1.0`** to npm — first public package
- npm token created from Adam's iMac (needed fnm install for Node.js)

## Stripe Enters x402

- **Stripe launched machine payments using x402 on Base with USDC**
- Jeff Weinstein (Stripe product) announced autonomous agent payments
- 14 lines of code for full integration
- `payment_method_types: ["crypto"]`, `mode: "custom"`
- Missing from Stripe: no agent identity, no reputation, no spending limits, no session management
- **Strategic pivot**: "Old pitch: We built x402 sessions. New pitch: Stripe handles settlement. We handle everything Stripe can't."
- Spend Sessions math: 1000 API calls = 1 settlement vs 1000 PaymentIntents — 500x reduction

## AgentHQ/BAiSE Landing Page Built

- Full landing page + 6-view SPA dashboard
- Bloomberg terminal aesthetic, dark theme
- Gemini reviewed: "absolute home run", "command center for autonomous machine economy"
- Landing page had agent onboarding modal (terminal-style code snippet)
- Dev friend shown screenshots, asked "what is it"

## AgentHQ Server Security — 36 Findings Fixed

- Round 1: 14 findings (API key leaked on registration, no auth on endpoints, etc.)
- Round 2: 7 more findings (async mutex broken, error boundaries, agent impersonation)
- Round 3: 11 more findings (broadcast race condition, rate limit hardening)
- All 36 fixed across 3 audit rounds
- Created `skills/node-api-audit/SKILL.md` — 8 attack categories from real findings
- Created `DEVELOPMENT.md` — 10-step process, 8 audit gates, 15 anti-patterns

## SDK v0.2.0

- Full task lifecycle: register → discover → bid → assign → complete
- 24 tests passing
- WebSocket streaming
- Pushed to GitHub + npm

## x402 Ecosystem Deep Dive

- Studied full x402.org docs: lifecycle hooks, Bazaar discovery, SIWX, payment-identifier, MCP integration, FAQ
- Coinbase agentic-wallet-skills repo studied (search-for-service, pay-for-service, monetize-service)
- x402.eco: $100M settled already
- Roadmap: `upto` scheme (pay actual usage), `stream` (streaming payments), `permit2`
- CoinGecko x402 pay-per-use tutorial found — real adoption proof

## ERC-8128 & ERC-8004 Skills

- ERC-8128 skill built from full SliceKit docs (14 pages)
- Read all sections: security model, binding modes, replay protection, smart contracts, API reference
- ERC-8004 skill rewritten from EIP spec
- 8004scan.io registration for BAiSED added to todo list

## Revenue Model Locked

- Low fees, high volume (Stripe model)
- 1-2% platform fee on task settlements
- At scale: 100K transactions/day × $0.05 avg × 1% = $50/day growing
- No high fees — "volume and low fees to fund us"

## Credentials & Infrastructure

- Etherscan API key: `6VMQBBH5WT4G77BVPXDDAZT9P3GBTWB4G1`
- CDP API key created (View/Trade/Transfer/Server Wallet)
- CDP Wallet Secret obtained
- CDP onchain data skill built (SQL API, webhooks, RPC)
- Polymarket Builder registered: `0x5cdda04d8f75befaacb49811788c109eb0cec2c5`
- Polymarket CLOB API keys + wallet private key stored in .env

## Cogent Project Born

- AI agent trading platform for Polymarket prediction markets
- Named "Cogent" — clear reasoning, sharp decisions
- 4 agent strategies built: Whale Tracker, Arbitrage Scanner, Contrarian, Sentiment
- Paper-trade mode running against real Polymarket data
- Arbitrage scanner found 21.8% price divergence on first scan
- Dashboard: Arena view, agent leaderboard, activity feed, market explorer
- Revenue: builder fee share from Polymarket trades
- Competitor: AIXBET analyzed — token-gated, garbage UX, "we want business and real revenue"

## Bug Bounty Exploration

- HackenProof account exists (Adam already registered)
- Explored: NEAR Intents SDK bounty ($100-$20K range), MyBucks password cracking ($1,100), Gate.io ($250 total paid — passed)
- Decision: bug bounties deprioritized in favor of building products
- Need more reputation points before qualifying for good bounties

## ROADMAP.md Written

- 5 phases with revenue model and stack diagram
- Positioning against GitHub's Agent HQ
- Clean enough for pitch deck

## Key Decisions

- "Show don't tell" — no DM to Dan Romero until hooks are shipped
- Repos going private while building (competitive advantage)
- Server Wallet (CDP SDK) > awal for programmatic signing
- French meaning of "baise" acknowledged but deemed acceptable in English crypto context
- Marketing idea: 100 × $1 bounties for agents to recruit 10 agents each → 1000 agents for $100
